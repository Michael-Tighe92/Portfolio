#### Garage Lab - Oct 2013

- This lab reads in from a file called test and pushes a car's license to a stack. The stack's size is 10, there is two lanes and a street that represent the stack. The cars can only be parked inside of the lanes and not the street. If the car is departing then it searches the stack to determine which lane the car is in. 

- Cars that are being moved out of the stack while searching for the departed car get moved to either a lane or street. Cars that have been moved must return to the proper lane when the car is found and departed. This lab also takes into consideration on how many times the car has been moved and will let the user know when departed.
